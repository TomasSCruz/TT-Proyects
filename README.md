# Projects TripleTen

This repository comprises all the courses I did in the TripleTen bootcamp. Each folder corresponds to a project belonging to a sprint on a particular topic in the field of Data Science.
 
1. [**Music Project**](https://github.com/TomasSCruz/TT-Proyects/blob/main/Proyecto%20Music/Proyecto%20Music.ipynb): The beginning of everything, this is where my first knowledge of Python took shape. The project consists of preprocessing data and testing 3 hypotheses.
2. [**Project Credit**](https://github.com/TomasSCruz/TT-Proyects/blob/main/Proyecto%20Credit/Proyecto%20Credit.ipynb): A project similar to the previous one but much more real. Although the objectives were the same, the data were much more real, so it involved much more preprocessing to answer the same amount of questions.
3. [**Crankshaft List Project**](https://github.com/TomasSCruz/TT-Proyects/blob/main/Proyecto%20Crankshaft%20List/Proyecto%20Crankshaft%20List.ipynb): This is where it starts to look a bit more like a normal workflow as it includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and instead of a concrete question that can be answered by hypothesis testing, it is about what factors determine the price of a vehicle.4. [**Megaline Project**](https://github.com/TomasSCruz/TT-Proyects/blob/main/Proyecto%20Megaline/Proyecto%20Megaline.ipynb): Again, this project is similar to the previous one as it involves mainly EDA, but with a _twist_ as the data comes in several tables. Therefore to answer the questions posed you have to create a table with the necessary data and further enrich the table.
4. [**Megaline Project**](https://github.com/TomasSCruz/TT-Proyects/blob/main/Proyecto%20Megaline/Proyecto%20Megaline.ipynb): Again, this project is similar to the previous one as it involves mainly EDA, but with a _twist_ as the data comes in several tables. Therefore to answer the questions posed you have to create a table with the necessary data and further enrich the table. 
5. [**Games Project**](https://github.com/TomasSCruz/TT-Proyects/blob/main/Proyecto%20Games/Proyecto%20Games.ipynb): This project represents the culmination of everything learned so far, from preprocessing to EDA. The objective in this case was to answer two questions, through hypothesis testing, regarding the platform of the games and the genre.
6. [**Taxi Rides Project**](https://github.com/TomasSCruz/TT-Proyects/blob/main/Proyecto%20Taxi%20Rides/Proyecto%20Taxi%20Rides.ipynb): This stage focused on learning SQL (PostgreSQL in particular), so the first part consisted of obtaining the data directly from the database. Later I performed similar procedures to the previous ones to test the impact of rainy days on a cab route.
7. [**Ultra Smart Project**](https://github.com/TomasSCruz/TT-Proyects/blob/main/Proyecto%20Ultra%20Smart/Proyecto%20Ultra_Smart.ipynb): The first Machine Learning project! This project is about developing a ML model to determine which phone plan would be better for a customer (Smart or Ultra). Still new to the subject, just use simple models like DecisionTree, RandomForest and LogisticRegression from sklearn.
8. [**Beta Bank Project**](https://github.com/TomasSCruz/TT-Proyects/blob/main/Proyecto%20Beta%20Bank/Proyecto%20Beta%20Bank.ipynb): For this project the objective was a classification problem in which it has to be determined whether a customer is going to stop being a customer of a bank later on. For this, apart from the standard, I had to deal with a class imbalance using basic methods and compare which was more effective.
9. [**Project OilyGiant**](https://github.com/TomasSCruz/TT-Proyects/blob/main/Proyecto%20OilyGiant/Proyecto%20OilyGiant.ipynb): This project was very interesting because not knowing exactly what each column means one has to resort to a very peculiar analysis. The objective was to find the area with the highest possibility of gain.
10. [**Project Gold**](https://github.com/TomasSCruz/TT-Proyects/blob/main/Proyecto%20Gold/Proyecto%20Gold.ipynb): A project that carried an intrinsic difficulty due to the complexity of the process. The objective was to build a model to predict the amount of gold obtained by means of random forest models.
11. [**Insurance project**](https://github.com/TomasSCruz/TT-Proyects/blob/main/Proyecto%20Insurance/Proyecto%20Insurance.ipynb): Here a more technical approach was taken to the data of an insurance benefit. First an analysis of the data with NearestNeighbors was performed, then variations of the dummy models were explored, followed by the creation of a linear regression model and finally an analysis of data obfuscation.
12. [Rusty Bargain Project](https://github.com/TomasSCruz/TT-Proyects/blob/main/Proyecto%20Rusty%20Bargain/Proyecto%20Rusty%20Bargain.ipynb): The first project in which I started to test more “advanced” models such as LightGBM or CatBoost. The goal was to predict the market value of a vehicle based on multiple vehicle characteristics.
13. [**Sweet Lyft Taxi project**](https://github.com/TomasSCruz/TT-Proyects/blob/main/Proyecto%20Sweet%20Lyft%20Taxi/Proyect%20Sweet%20Lyft%20Taxi.ipynb): In a few words, a time series project. The goal is to predict the amount of cab orders for the next hour, for that I used models like XGBoost and LightGBM.
14. [Film Junky Union Project**](https://github.com/TomasSCruz/TT-Proyects/blob/main/Proyecto%20Film%20Junky%20Union/Proyecto%20Film%20Junky%20Union.ipynb): This project consists of the creation of text learning models that must correctly interpret whether a review is positive or negative.Combinations of Linear Regression, LightGBM, spaCy and NLTK were tested.
15. [**Faces project**](https://github.com/TomasSCruz/TT-Proyects/blob/main/Proyecto%20Faces/Proyecto%20Faces.ipynb): A neural network project could not be missing. Here a ResNet50-based network using Keras is used to determine the age of a person based on the face. Sadly the training process is not in the notebook as it was trained in the cloud.
16. [Interconnect Project](https://github.com/TomasSCruz/TT-Proyects/blob/main/Proyecto%20Interconnect/Proyecto%20Interconnect.ipynb): The final project of the course and the culmination of what has been learned. The objective of the project is to forecast the churn rate of a telecommunications company. The part that stands out from the previous projects is the conclusion and the study of the model.
